## 2025-05-15 - Deferring Google Maps with Click-to-load
**Learning:** Deferring heavy third-party embeds (like Google Maps) using a 'Click-to-load' pattern is a highly effective optimization for this project, significantly reducing initial page load weight and requests. This is especially useful for mobile users or those on slower connections who may not need the map immediately.
**Action:** Always check for heavy iframes or third-party scripts that can be deferred until user interaction.
